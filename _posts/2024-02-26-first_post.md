## Today's Learning
So for my first post my learning for the day can be summarized as:
- [x] Read about Rust Macros in [The Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch19-06-macros.html)
- [x] Learned about GitHub codespaces using [the github skills course](https://github.com/skills/code-with-codespaces).
- [x] Learned about GitHub pages using [the github skills course](https://github.com/skills/github-pages)

## Outputs
- Created a GitHub codespaces repository which demonstrates how to customize codespaces.
- Made a learning diary repository to log my technical skills acquisition.
